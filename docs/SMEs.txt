Given Funnelfit's current manual bookkeeping process, here's a phased workflow for evolving towards a digital bookkeeping service mirroring Pilot.com's approach. This workflow aims to create a customer-centric solution while ensuring efficiency and scalability.Phase 1: Manual to Semi-Automated (Foundation Building)The goal of this initial phase is to digitize existing manual processes and introduce basic automation.* 1.1. Client Onboarding & Data Collection:o Action (SME): Client signs up via a basic online form (e.g., Google Form, Typeform) providing company name, contact, and basic financial overview. Initially, they manually provide bank statements and other financial documents via email or secure file transfer (e.g., Dropbox/Google Drive).o System (Funnelfit): Dedicated internal team receives and stores documents. Initial client information is entered into a simple CRM/spreadsheet.o Action (Funnelfit): A dedicated bookkeeper reviews initial documents and sends a checklist of required information (e.g., access to bank accounts for read-only, credit card statements, payroll reports, previous tax returns) via email.o Benefit: Centralizes initial client data and establishes a standardized, albeit manual, document collection process.* 1.2. Transaction Categorization & Reconciliation (Manual with Digital Tools):o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): Bookkeeper manually imports bank and credit card statements into accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks Desktop, Xero, or a basic in-house spreadsheet system). Transactions are categorized manually based on a predefined chart of accounts.o System (Accounting Software): Records transactions.o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): Reconciliation of bank and credit card accounts is performed manually within the software. Discrepancies are flagged for client inquiry.o Benefit: Establishes a digital record of transactions and introduces the use of accounting software for core bookkeeping.* 1.3. Communication & Clarification:o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): For uncategorized or unclear transactions, the bookkeeper compiles a list of questions and sends them to the client via email.o Action (SME): Client responds to queries via email.o Benefit: Ensures accuracy of categorization through direct client input.* 1.4. Basic Reporting:o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): Monthly basic financial reports (P&L, Balance Sheet) are generated from the accounting software and sent to the client as PDF attachments via email.o Benefit: Provides clients with initial financial visibility.Phase 2: Automated Integration & Basic Platform (Developing Pilot-like Features)This phase introduces more direct integrations and a rudimentary client portal to reduce manual effort and improve client experience.* 2.1. Integrated Client Portal (Basic Version):o Action (Funnelfit Development): Implement a simple client portal.o System (Portal): Allows clients to securely upload documents. Provides a basic dashboard to view the status of their bookkeeping. Secure messaging feature is introduced.o Action (SME): Clients upload documents and communicate directly via the portal.o Benefit: Reduces reliance on email for document transfer and enhances communication security.* 2.2. Bank Feed & Automated Categorization (Partial):o Action (Funnelfit Development): Integrate directly with common bank feeds (e.g., via API for read-only access).o System (Accounting Software/Tool): Transactions are automatically pulled from bank accounts. Initial automated categorization rules are set up within the accounting software.o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): Bookkeeper reviews and approves automatically categorized transactions. Manual categorization is still performed for complex or new transactions.o Benefit: Significantly reduces manual data entry and speeds up transaction processing.* 2.3. Query Management System:o Action (Funnelfit Bookkeeper): Instead of email, bookkeepers submit transaction queries directly within the portal.o System (Portal): A dedicated "Queries" section for clients to view and respond to outstanding questions. Notifications are sent to clients for new queries.o Benefit: Centralizes communication regarding transactions, making it easier for clients to track and respond.* 2.4. Expense Management Integration (Optional Early Stage):o Action (Funnelfit Development): Research and potentially integrate with a simple expense management tool for clients to snap receipts.o Benefit: Automates receipt collection and matching to transactions.
